# CanisiusCollegeProjects
Coding Projects in Python, C++, Python, Lisp, and R

Enclosed in this repository are my coding projects completed on my personal computer during my time as a student of Computer Science at Canisius College.
Some classes are not included as they had coding projects completed in the on-campus lab workstations instead of our personal machines.
It ranges from entry level Python to more advanced algorithms in C++ and data analysis using R.
Files are organized by class, then the project. Each project folder contains any accessory files necessary to run the program.
