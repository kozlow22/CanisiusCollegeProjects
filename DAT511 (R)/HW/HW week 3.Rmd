```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

a.) Take in a single vector of values, say x=seq(1,10,1),  and return a data frame with three columns, x, x^2 and x^3
```{R}
x = seq(1,10,1)
frame = data.frame(x, x^2, x^3)
frame
```

b.) Take in an investment value V and an annual interest rate R, and compute the value of the investment 1 year from now.
```{R}
v = 50000
r = 0.03
time = 1

interest = (v * r) * time
total = interest + v
total
```

c.)  Take in a vector of values, and return only the values greater than 5.
```{R}
x
greaterfive = which(x > 5)
greaterfive
```
